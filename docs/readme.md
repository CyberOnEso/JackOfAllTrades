Automatically adjusts your green champion bar loadout depending on what you are attempting to achieve and restores back your old CP setup when you are done.

## Crafting
- Automatically slots Master Gatherer and Plentiful Harvest when you start harvesting a crafting node.
- Automaitcally slots Meticulous Disassembly when you start crafting, ensuring you always get optimal refining results!

## Riding
- Automatically slots Gifted Rider, and War Mount whenever your mount up!

## Looting
- Automatically slots Treasure Hunter, and Homemaker whenver you are looting the relevant container.

## Fishing
- Slots Reel Technique and Angler's Instincts whenever you start fishing.

## Thieving
- Slots Sustaing Shadows whenever you start sneaking, keeping you in the dark for longer!
- Slots Infamous whenever you interact with a fence, helping you always get the best selling price.
- Slots Cutpurse's Art whenever you pickpocket someone.
- Slots shadowstrike when you can use the Blade of Woe.

It will only equip the skills if you have enough points into them already. This addon will not charge you 3000 gold etc.

It is intended to be a seamless quality of life improvement, not a CP respec addon.

## Optional Features
- Get a notification whenver any skill you wish to be notifed for is slotted
- Recieve a warning message whenever you don't have enough points into a star for it to be automatically slotted
- Disable automatically slotting any skill you wish
- Remap where on your champion bar skills will be automatically slotted to.

If anyone has time to test this addon or can provide me with any thoughts, additions, or improvements I would be very grateful.

Many thanks
