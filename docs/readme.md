Automatically adjusts your green champion bar loadout depending on what you are attempting to achieve and restores back your old CP setup when you are done.

### Meticulous Dissasmebly
Whenever you interact with a crafting station that supports Meticulous Dissasmebly it will automatically be slotted onto your champion bar.
Allowing you to refine materials with the buff always active.

### Treasure Hunter
Whenever you lockpick a chest it will automatically equip the Treasure Hunter skill.
Ensuring your chests are always of the highest quality

### Gifted Rider & War Mount
Whenever you mount it will automatically equip the Gifted Rider & War Mount skills if you have them unlocked.

### Professional Upkeep
Whenever you interact with a merchant it will automatically equip Professional Upkeep, allowing you to always get the lowest repair cost on your gear.

This addon will not respec your champion points, and will not charge you 3000 gold etc.
It will only equip the skills if you have enough points into them already.
It is intended to be a seamless quality of life improvement, not a CP respec addon.

If anyone has time to test this addon or can provide me with any thoughts, additions, or improvements I would be very grateful.

Many thanks
